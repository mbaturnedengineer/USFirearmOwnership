# USFirearmOwnership
The repository is part of an RA Task performed for Prof. Bradley Shapiro of Booth School of Business, University of Chicago which investigates the relationships between Firearm ownership and crime rates in the United States
<br/> The Repo contains source files which contain firearm data from 2014 to 2020. Further, it contains information about the number of BG checks performed annually and statewise crime rates for the same time periods. These can be found in Data Sources.
<br/> The analysis involved studying the relationship between these three variables through many smaller tasks which have all been outlined in the Analysis Doc. The RCode is contained in the file named RATask_Code. The entire activity had been coded in R.
